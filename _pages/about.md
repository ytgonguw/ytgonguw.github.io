I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My research interests are at the intersection of health economics, public policy, and agricultural economics. I am on the 2023-2024 job market.

My job market paper is titled "Taxing for Health: The Enduring Benefits of In-Utero Cigarette Tax Exposure on Adult Health". 

In recent years, the relationship between public policies and public health outcomes has gained increasing attention. In this context, my job market paper delves into a crucial aspect of this intersection. It explores the lasting effects of in utero exposure to cigarette taxes on long-term health development and the underlying mechanisms. Understanding how cigarette taxation policies during pregnancy can impact adult health not only sheds light on the broader debate around public health and cigarette regulation policies but also has significant implications for policymakers and healthcare practitioners. This paper aims to uncover the intricate connections between taxation and adult well-being.
