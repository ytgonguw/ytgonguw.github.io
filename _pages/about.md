I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My research interests are at the intersection of health economics, public policy, and agricultural economics. I am on the 2023-2024 job market.

My job market paper, titled “Does in utero exposure to cigarette taxes improve adult health?”, explores the impact of  early life exposure of cigarette taxes on the long-term health capital accumulation and the underlying mechanisms.
